# CS2080-003-group8-repo
Welcome to CS2080 group 8's repository! In this repo we have saved our work towards creation of a secure NAS system for safely storing and encrypting user data off-site.

Our main goals for this project include: -Using the benefit of NAS to the benefit of our local systems -Simplicty of use for each user of the system -Being budget-minded in a way that allows the cost-of-entry barrier to be as low as possible by using cheap and widely-available hardware. -This system is also meant to be used as a collaborative tool from our local machines on campus as we work on future projects *(Similar to Github but being primarily used for other file types then just code!)
