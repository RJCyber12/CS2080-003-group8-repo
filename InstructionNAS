Configure storage

Find your drive

To see the storage devices currently connected to your system, run the following command:

$ lsblk
You should see output similar to the following:

NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda           8:0    0   1.8T  0 disk
mmcblk0     179:0    0 238.8G  0 disk
├─mmcblk0p1 179:1    0   256M  0 part /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 179:2    0 238.5G  0 part /

Partition drive
Next, partition your drive.

$ sudo fdisk /dev/sda
When prompted:

Enter n to create a new partition.

If a partition already exists, use d to delete it.

Enter p for primary partition.

Use the default option for all other prompts.

WARNING
Back up all data stored on the external drive before you partition! The partition process will erase the drive.
Format drive
Now that the drive has been partitioned, we need to format it. The following command formats the drive into the ext4 file system:

$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
Mount drive
Next, mount the drive to make it available to the file system.

$ sudo mount /dev/sda1
And ensure that the drive is mounted after each boot:

$ sudo nano /etc/fstab
Add the following line at the end of the file:

/dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1/ ext4 defaults,noatime 0 1
Press Ctrl+X, then Y, and Enter to save the edited file with nano.

Create a shared folder
Run the following command to create a shared folder on your drive:

$ sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/sda1/shared
Run the following command to grant read, write, and execute permissions to the folder to all users:

$ sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/sda1/shared
Share drive over your network

Run the following command to install Samba, a tool that shares directories over a network between computers:

$ sudo apt install samba samba-common-bin
Then tell Samba to share the directory over the network. We can give Samba instructions via the Samba configuration file, smb.conf. Open the configuration file in an editor:

$ sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
And add the following line at the end of the file:

[shared]
path=/mnt/sda1/shared
writeable=Yes
create mask=0777
directory mask=0777
public=no
Press Ctrl+X, then Y, and finally Enter to save the edited file with nano.

Restart Samba to load the configuration changes:

$ sudo systemctl restart smbd
Grant drive access
Finally, you’ll want to grant access to your Samba share so only authenticated users can access files over the network.

Run the following command to create a user to manage Samba sharing:

$ sudo adduser nas-user
And add a password to that user with the following command:

$ sudo smbpasswd -a username
